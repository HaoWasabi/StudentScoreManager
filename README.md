# ClassManager 
This program was built based on the Python codes to enter student score I created in the previous semester.

With the criteria of applying technology to optimize the work, hope it can help us to manage student score faster.

## What's new in 1.0.5 CLI version?
- Change the score value to real number.
- Additional sorting menu.
- Fix errors and improve performance.
